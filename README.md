# Portfolio for Kelly Johnson

This is the portfolio page for my projects current and future.  This site has been deployed at [kellyjohnson364.github.io/knj-portfolio-page](https://kellyjohnson364.github.io/knj-portfolio-page/). This portfolio page includes my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my projects, and my contact information.  Each of these sections are accesible through links in the navigation bar in the header. The section showcasing my projects includes images that act as links to deployed projects (if they exsist yet.) Nature images were added to improve the asthetics of the site while waiting for future project images. The image for my first project/homework assignment is larger than the others.  This site should work on all screen sizes as shown in the following screenshots.
